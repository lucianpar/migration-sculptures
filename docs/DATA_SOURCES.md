## Supplementary Data Sources

### OBIS-SEAMAP

**Website:** https://seamap.env.duke.edu/

OBIS-SEAMAP (Ocean Biogeographic Information System - Spatial Ecological Analysis of Megavertebrate Populations) provides aggregated marine animal tracking and sighting data from various research projects.

**Relevant Datasets:**

1. **Gray Whales Count**
   - Dataset ID: `1899b433-f6e2-40e4-827c-94d6f59785d3`
   - Land-based survey of northbound gray whale migration
   - Location: Santa Barbara Channel (Goleta)
   - Time period: 2011-2012
   - ~1,965 observations

### NOAA Animal Telemetry Network (ATN)

**Website:** https://ioos.noaa.gov/project/atn/

ATN hosts telemetry data for marine animals tracked by NOAA and partner institutions. Some data may require data use agreements with original researchers.

## Data Quality Notes

1. **Satellite Tag Accuracy:** Argos satellite positions have varying accuracy classes. The processing pipeline filters out low-quality fixes and unrealistic speeds.

2. **Temporal Coverage:** Coverage varies by year and season. Some years may have insufficient tracks for standalone sculptures and may be combined with adjacent years.

3. **Geographic Scope:** Primary focus is the Santa Barbara Channel region, but tracks may extend into adjacent waters.
